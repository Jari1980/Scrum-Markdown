# Scrum video summary by Jari Tenhunen

## Introduction

In this document I summarize and share my thoughts, regarding importance and uses, on a Youtube video about Scrum from CODEX Community provided by Lexicon Växjö.

## Section 1: Main idea

- **Key Idea 1**: Scrum - Systematic Customer Resolution Unraveling Meeting, is a type of project management with goal of create and deliver products faster.
- **Key Idea 2**: Clear and short workflow.
- **Key Idea 3**: Clear roles.

### Subsection

Scrum workflow consist of the stages: Productplanning, Sprint Backlog, Sprint, Potential product and sprint review. This is usually done within 1-2 weeks but can extend to a period of 4 weeks. 

There are three roles in a typical Scrum setting which are: Product owner, Scrum master and the Team members.
Three artifacts used in Scrum are: Product backlog, Sprint backlog and Burndown chart.
Finally there are three ceremonies in Scrum which are Spring planning, Daily Scrum and Sprint review.



## Section 2: Analysis


- **Bullet Point 1**: Agile - In my thinking time is one of the key things here, with smaller and shorter projects it is easy to work with the most urgent parts of the project first also if problem occurs these will likely be found fast.
- **Bullet Point 2**: Predictable - Estimating time and resources in shorter parts in projects will be easier and more accurate.
- **Bullet Point 3**: Tangible - Recording time and resources used in a project is easier with a clear system.
- **Bullet Point 4**: In the video it is said that the workflow usually ranges within 1-2 weeks but I think this is the time for a sprint, which according to the video are microreleases consisting of the stages Planning, building, Testing and Release, there are usually several sprints within a project.


## Section 3: Conclusion


- **Takeaway 1**: Working systematically, methodic and according to a pattern tend end with really good results hence adapting Scrum as a way of project management is common within software business.
